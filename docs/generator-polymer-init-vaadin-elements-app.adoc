----
[prompt]#$# [command]#npm# install -g polymer-cli generator-polymer-init-vaadin-elements-app
----

Then you can create a new application with polymer init, using vaadin-elements-app template:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mkdir# [replaceable]#my-project#
[prompt]#$# [command]#cd# [replaceable]#my-project#
[prompt]#$# [command]#polymer# init vaadin-elements-app

= Test the application

The template includes automated tests, which are located in the test/ directory. To run the tests,
use this command:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#polymer# test
----

= Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates Service workers.
The minified files are output to the build/unbundled folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

The command also creates a build/bundled folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.
